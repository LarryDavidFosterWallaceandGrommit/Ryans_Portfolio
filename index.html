<h3> My Professional Productions</h3>
<p> Here is a PSA that I wrote, directed, edited, and filmed (as well as very briefly appeared in) as part of a high-school related grant (CESA 12):</p>

<br>
<p> The grant was related to technological literacy, and the provided topic was the importance of keeping your online presence modest. A second PSA was in production, but was never finished due to the initial COVID-19 lockdown.</p>
<p> Here is a promotional video I was commissioned to do by my school district:</p>

<p> This video was displayed on my area's Chamber of Commerce website. <br>I also was interviewed for this video by a local newspaper, which you can read <a target="_blank" href="https://www.superiortelegram.com/news/education/4935650-Student-focuses-lens-on-Maple-schools">here</a>.</p>
<p> An extended-cut was also produced and sold to the school district, and I was also commisioned to produce a second video with 2020 graduation and spring-activity coverage, but was unfortunately cancelled due to Covid and school moving online for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p> Here is a promotional video I produced for a family-owned groccery store: <br>
